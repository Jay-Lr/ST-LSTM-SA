# ST-LSTM-SA
## A spatiotemporal deep learning model ST-LSTM-SA for hourly rainfall forecasting using radar echo images

### Introduction
A spatiotemporal prediction model, namely the Spatial Temporal Long Short-Term Memory based on the self-attentive mechanism (ST-LSTM-SA) was proposed. This model enables better aggregation of sequence features inspired by proposed improvements. The encapsulated 3D convolution is developed to fully exploit the short-term spatiotemporal information, and the channel correlation is modeled by self-attention mechanism to further improve representations in the long-term interaction.
